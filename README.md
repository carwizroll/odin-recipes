Introduction

This is my first full project to attempt on Odin Project. 

In this project, I'm going to build a basic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The purpose of this project is just to practice HTML skills; I will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.
